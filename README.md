# Zotero Citation Counts Manager

This is an add-on for Zotero, a research source management tool. The
add-on can auto-fetch citation counts for journal articles using
various APIs, including Crossref (and in the future probably Inspire
HEP, NASA/ADS, and Semantic Scholar). (Google Scholar is not supported
because automated access is against its terms of service.)

Please report any bugs, questions, or feature requests in the Github
repository.

Code for this extension is based on the [Zotero DOI
 Manager](https://github.com/bwiernik/zotero-shortdoi), which is based
 in part on [Zotero Google Scholar
 Citations](https://github.com/beloglazov/zotero-scholar-citations) by
 Anton Beloglazov.
